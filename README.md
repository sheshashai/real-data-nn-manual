# 🏠 Real Data Regression – Manual Neural Network (No Autograd)

This project trains a 2-layer neural network **from scratch (no autograd)** to predict house prices using the **California Housing Dataset**.

## 🔧 Model Architecture

- Input: 8 real-world features (e.g., population, income, rooms)
- Hidden Layer: 3 neurons with ReLU
- Output Layer: 1 neuron (regression)

## 🧠 What’s Special

- Real dataset (not synthetic)
- Manual gradients (no autograd or optimizer)
- Clean training loop and loss curve
